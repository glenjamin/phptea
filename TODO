Refactoring
-----------

Break apart Core.php - it has too many responsibilities
    - Builder
    - Runner (this can be the event dispatcher)
    - Top level example collection

Relegate example / example group to containers only
    - Pull out the execution logic into a runner class

Tidy up command-line runner
    - help text

Move actual application logic out of RunCommand

Short Term
----------
colour
pending tests
beforeEach / afterEach
TeaCup - context object

Short-ish Term
--------------
--grep
--halt-on-fail
Glob for test files
describe(!"desc") & it("!test") for quick disabling

Medium Term
-----------
Test timings
Improve formatters & add more
Figure out how to self-test
Config format

Longer Term
-----------
Code coverage
Global variable leak detection
Sugars - standardised way to plug-in extra functionality
    - assertions
    - mocking
    - growl
